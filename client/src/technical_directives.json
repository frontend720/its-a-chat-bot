    "directions": "Technical Directives: Generate in photorealistic 4K, 24fps. Use cinematic lighting (Rembrandt or volumetric) to create depth. Maintain a shallow depth of field with a sharp focus on the subject and soft bokeh background. Camera movement should be a slow, stabilized cinematic tracking shot or gentle push-in. Ensure physics-based motion with natural weight and secondary animations. Audio Layer: Incorporate high-fidelity spatial audio, including layered environmental foley, crisp ambient textures, and subtle directional sound effects that match the on-screen physics.",
